Impact:
The customer-facing authentication service experienced a complete outage.
95% of users attempting to log in were unable to access the system.
Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the recent deployment process led to an incorrect update in the authentication service's configuration files.
Timeline:

09:00 AM: Issue Detection
The issue was detected through a spike in error rates and a surge in customer complaints.
09:15 AM: Initial Investigation
Engaged monitoring tools to identify the affected service.
Assumed the issue might be related to recent code changes.
09:30 AM: Misleading Path
Focused on database performance initially due to a recent update, but data analysis disproved this assumption.
10:00 AM: Escalation
The incident was escalated to the DevOps and Deployment team for a thorough investigation.
11:00 AM: Root Cause Identified
Discovered a misconfiguration in the deployment script affecting the authentication service.
11:30 AM: Issue Resolved
Rolled back the recent deployment to the last known stable version, restoring service functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The deployment script inadvertently replaced critical configuration files, causing the authentication service to fail.
Resolution:
Rolled back to the previous deployment, restoring the correct configuration.
Implemented additional checks in the deployment pipeline to prevent configuration file overwrites.
